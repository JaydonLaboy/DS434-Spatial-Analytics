## The Innovation: geosam + SAM3

**What's New?**

Meta's **Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3)** is a breakthrough in computer vision that can identify and segment any object in an image with unprecedented accuracy. The **geosam** R package brings this power to renewable energy researchers by making it simple to detect solar panels from satellite imagery.

**Why This Matters:**

Tracking rooftop solar requires:
- ❌ Building permit records (incomplete, delayed, missing off-grid systems)
- ❌ Utility interconnection databases (voluntary reporting, paperwork gaps)
- ❌ Manual surveys (expensive, slow, quickly outdated)

**Now, with geosam + SAM3:**
- ✅ Detect visible solar panel from satelite iagery
- ✅ Get exact locations and panel areas
- ✅ Update as often as new satellite imagery is available
- ✅ Find "dark solar" that's invisible to utilities

**Your Challenge:**

Explore the resources below to understand Hawaii's renewable energy landscape, then design a research plan that uses geosam's unique capabilities to answer a question that couldn't be answered before.

## Part 1: Resource Analysis

For each resource, read/explore the content and write **3-5 key takeaways** that could inform a geosam-based research project. Focus on:
- What data sources are currently used (and their limitations)
- What questions remain unanswered
- What problems need solving
- How geosam could add new insights

### Resource 1: Solar PV Installation in Honolulu (Sep 2017)

📄 **[Solar PV Installation in Honolulu - DBEDT Report](https://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/economic/data_reports/Solar_PV_Installation_In_Honolulu_Sep2017.pdf)**

**What it is:** Comprehensive analysis of solar adoption patterns across Oahu neighborhoods using building permit data from 2000-2017. Shows dramatic variation in adoption rates by census tract (4% to 62%) and correlates adoption with income, homeownership, and housing type.

**Your 3-5 Key Takeaways:**

1. A peak in PV installations occurred between September and December 2012.

2. Non residential PV installations (hotels, industrial, and commercial buildings) made up around 2% of total PV permits, but accounted for 27% of total PV permit value due to larger project sizes.

3. Between 2000 and June 2017, Honolulu County issued 56,655 PV permits with a combined reported value of around $2.16 billion.

4. This is a test

### Resource 2: The Effect of Residential Solar PV Systems on Home Value (Wee, 2016)

📄 **[Research Article - Renewable Energy Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148116300593)**

**What it is:** Academic study finding that homes with solar sold for 5.4% more ($35,000) than comparable homes. Uses hedonic pricing model with building permit and home sales data. Discusses circuit capacity limits as a driver of solar value.

**Your 3-5 Key Takeaways:**

1. Solar PV systems were found to be fully capitalized into home values, meaning buyers recognize and pay for their benefits.

2. The value of PV systems exceeded installation costs by about $5,000

3. High electricity prices and tax credits made Hawaiʻi an ideal case study for assessing solar value.

4. State and federal incentives, including a 30% federal tax credit and a 35% Hawaiʻi tax credit, accelerated solar adoption.

5.

### Resource 3: Hawaiian Electric Integrated Grid Planning

🔗 **[HECO Integrated Grid Planning Portal](https://www.hawaiianelectric.com/clean-energy-hawaii/integrated-grid-planning)**

**What it is:** HECO's comprehensive planning framework for achieving 100% renewable energy by 2045. Explains grid challenges, circuit capacity constraints, and the critical role of distributed (rooftop) solar in Hawaii's clean energy transition.

**Your 3-5 Key Takeaways:**

1. Integrated Grid Planning guides Hawaiʻi’s transition to a resilient, reliable electric grid powered by local renewable energy sources.

2. The Integrated Grid Plan outlines actionable steps to decarbonize Hawaiʻi’s electric grid while remaining flexible to future technologies and changing energy needs.

3. Key strategies include retiring fossil fuel plants, expanding energy storage and geothermal resources, adding at least 1 gigawatt of clean energy projects, and creating customer incentives for clean energy use.

4.  The IGP was developed through extensive public and stakeholder engagement, updated after public comments, and accepted by the Public Utilities Commission on March 7, 2024.

5. There is a four step Integrated Grid Planning process, Data Collection → Plan Definition → Creating a Clean Energy Marketplace → Plan Refinement—illustrating how Hawaiʻi moves from research to action.

### Resource 4: Renewable Energy Zones (REZ) Map

🗺️ **[Interactive REZ Map - hawaiipowered.com](https://hawaiipowered.com/rez/)**

**What it is:** Interactive map showing potential locations for utility-scale wind and solar projects based on land suitability, transmission capacity, and environmental constraints. Developed by HECO and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).

**Your 3-5 Key Takeaways:**

1. Suitable areas for utility scale renewables cluster in specific inland and leeward regions.

2. Forest reserves, conservation lands, and culturally important areas are largely excluded, narrowing development to already disturbed landscapes.

3. Windward zones appear more constrained due to terrain, conservation lands, and community sensitivity

4. 

5.

### Resource 5: Inputs & Assumptions Dashboard

📊 **[HECO Planning Assumptions Dashboard](https://hawaiipowered.com/iadashboard/)**

**What it is:** Interactive dashboard showing HECO's assumptions about future energy demand, distributed solar growth, electric vehicle adoption, and energy efficiency. Reveals how utilities forecast renewable energy integration through 2045.

**Your 3-5 Key Takeaways:**

1.  Hawaii aims to reach net zero carbon emissions and power its electric grid with 100% renewable energy, and progress is already underway, by 2021, 31.5% of energy sales came from renewable sources, keeping the state on track.

2. Future energy needs are highly uncertain and depend on changing customer behaviors, technology adoption, and economic conditions

3. The cost and availability of resources and land for new generation and transmission infrastructure strongly shape future energy costs for customers.

4. Customer energy efficiency choices directly influence total electricity demand, as more efficient appliances and lighting reduce overall grid load.

2. This question is important because targeting underutilized areas for solar deployment can accelerate Hawaii’s renewable energy transition and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels.

3. My geographic focus will be the entire island of Oahu

4. I will combine geosam solar data with Hawaiian Electric electricity consumption data and demographic information from the U.S. Census.

5. I will analyze correlations between solar potential, current electricity demand, and rooftop availability to identify higher priority sites for solar panel development.

6. I hope to discover neighborhoods where solar adoption is low despite high electricity demand and suitable rooftops.

7. These results could help policymakers and utility planners target incentives and infrastructure investments to make our renewable energy goal.

8. To verify geosam’s accuracy, I will cross-check predicted solar potential with actual PV installations documented by Hawaiian Electric.

9. Limitations include potential inaccuracies in rooftop data.

10. I would want my findings to  be used by state energy planners, utilities, and renewable energy developers to prioritize solar projects and optimize Hawaii’s transition to clean energy.
